# Interactive Mall Map 

This project is an interactive map designed to showcase the stores in a shopping mall. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface to locate stores and view additional information about them. The map includes rich data visualization features powered by modern web technologies.

## Overview

This project was created using pre-collected data. The dataset and map structure were based on Polish maps and existing data, combined with resources and examples from the [Leaflet.js official website](https://leafletjs.com/). The project utilizes **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and the **Leaflet.js library** to enable dynamic and interactive mapping functionality.

This is a university project aimed at providing an engaging and functional mall map that allows users to:
- Easily locate specific stores in the mall.
- Access detailed information about each store, including names, categories, and descriptions.
- Visualize store locations on an interactive, visually appealing map.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Users can click on specific areas of the map to highlight stores and view additional details.
- **Categorization**: Stores are grouped into categories (e.g., clothing, electronics, food) for better navigation.
- **Search Functionality**: (Add if your project includes a search feature) Easily find stores by their name or category.
- **Pop-ups**: Each store has a pop-up with more information, such as a description, logo, and external links (if available).
- **Dynamic Styling**: The map dynamically highlights areas with custom colors and styles to indicate different store categories.

## How to Run the Project

To run this project, you will need a local server environment. My personal recommendation is to use the **Visual Studio Code Live Server extension**, which provides an easy-to-set-up local hosting environment. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code**.
3. Install the **Live Server** extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace (if you haven't already).
4. Right-click on the `index.html` file and select `Open with Live Server`.
5. The project will open in your default web browser, and you can start interacting with the map.

## Libraries and Tools Used

- **Leaflet.js**: A powerful open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core web technologies for building the project interface and functionality.
- **Visual Studio Code**: Recommended development environment.

## Future Improvements

- **Search and Filtering**: Enhance the map with search and filtering options to make it easier to find specific stores.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Improve the design for better compatibility with mobile devices.
- **Additional Data Layers**: Add more details, such as parking areas, restrooms, and other amenities.

## Acknowledgments

This project was made possible by:
- Data collected from publicly available sources and pre-existing mall maps.
- Guidance and resources from the **Leaflet.js** official documentation.
- The inspiration and requirements set by my university course.
